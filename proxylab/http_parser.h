/**
 * @file http_parser.h
 * @brief Interface for HTTP parser
 *
 * This library is intended to be used to parse HTTP requests for CMU's 15-213
 * proxylab.
 *
 * When using the parser library, strings that are given to the parser by a
 * caller are still owned by the caller, and therefore should be cleaned up by
 * the caller. The values stored in the parser will still be vaild if the
 * strings given to the parser are freed or go out of scope. Strings either
 * returned by parser functions or given to a caller as an output parameter are
 * cleaned up by the parser when parser_free() is called, these strings should
 * not be modified by callers of parser functions.
